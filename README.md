This project has been realized by Bruno Vongxay and Romain Poddevin.

* Ruby version 5.2.1

The first project is a database containing 4 tables : Doctor, Patient, Appointment and Cities.
If you run the command rails:db:seed you'll find fake tables containing multiples values illustrating the purpose of this database.
